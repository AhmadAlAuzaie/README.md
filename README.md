I'm not just pursuing my academic career; I also bring a unique perspective as a cochlear implant hearing aid user, which fuels my determination and resilience in overcoming challenges in tech and beyond. Despite these challenges, I've maintained strong academic and technical prowess, aiming to make significant impacts in the fields of Cyber Security and AI.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find projects that showcase my skills in a variety of programming languages and technologies. I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the industry. I'm eager to contribute meaningfully in a professional setting and immerse myself in a dynamic and collaborative work environment.
